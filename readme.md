# About
This is a simple project that makes use of the HTML5 Canvas element to render out an aim trainer. Targets are pre-rendered, and rendering is double-buffered to smoothen out animation.

You can preview the project here: https://aimtrain.harmonylink.io/

# Todo
- Menu builder class with improved styling
- Event based communication
- Extra options for game configuration (game length, target size etc)
- Overlay to show stats during play
